# Hash Table

**Hash Table**
> Hash tables are used to store key-value pairs. They are like array but not ordered.
> Unlike arrays, hash tables are fast for all of the following operations: findinf values adding new values, and removing values!
> Hash tables in the WILD Python has Dictionary. Js has Object and Maps. Java, Go & Scala have Maps. Ruby has Hashes.
> Note: Objects have some restrictions,but are basically hash tables.


**Set**
- Accepts a key and a value
- Hashes the key
- Stores the key value pair in the hash table array via separate chaining

**Get**
- Accepts a key
- Hashes the key
- Retrives the key value pair in the hash table
- If the key isn't found, return undefined

**Keys**
1. Loops through the hash table array and returns an array of keys in the table

**Values**
1. Loops through the hash table array and returns an array of values in the table
